# Java IDE
Basic IDE for java built using Swing. Compiles on a separate thread on each key-stroke. Provides basic menus/shortcuts 
to create/save/run programs.

> Note: For now it's designed for windows OS. But it can be easily extended to run on other Unix based systems(Max/Linux) by making appropriate changes related to ```Runtime``` class.
